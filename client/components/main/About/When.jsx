        From late 2016 - early 2017, during the first half of the year following my college graduation, I spent my time in the New York music industry to get myself familiar with the affairs of the American music scene. The experience was educational, but to my concerns and perhaps to many in the industry, majority of the tasks was work that could be automated. So, pushed by my mixed intention to reform workspace and laziness towards work, I started off teaching myself how to code and found myself enjoying the experience. To accelerate my learning speed, I joined the 2017 February cohort of Fullstack Academy of Code in New York. There I met invaluable friends and mentors, gained practical and hollistic understanding of Javascript development, and now I feel comfortable and confident to take on new challenges as a developer. I currently reside in Japan where I work on personal projects and continue building my programming chops.

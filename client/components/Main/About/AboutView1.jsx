        Hi, my name is Keisuke Kido, a fullstack web developer. I used to be in the music industry, but recently I've decided to shift my footing to programming for various reasons. I just graduated Fullstack Academy of Code in New York 2017 May and I'm still new to the game, but so far I'm loving every step of the process.
